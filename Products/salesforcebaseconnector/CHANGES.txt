1.0 final (svn/unreleased)

 - Don't display a configured password in the configuration form. [davisagli]

 - Refactored credentials check so that invalid credentials will result in a warning
   shown to the user, rather than failing silently.  This closes issue #1. [andrewb, davisagli]
   
 - Integration test suites all based on CMFTestCase and creation of CMF Site,
   rather than PloneTestCase and Plone site for performance reasons [andrewb]

1.0-alpha3 

 - Added new publicly supported API "listFieldsRequiredForCreation" which
   encapsulates some of the rules for which fields are required upon object
   creation via the SOAP API for Salesforce.com.  The benefit being that 
   additional packages need not reproduce the following, which may evolve 
   anyway:
   
     not fieldData.nillable and \
        not fieldData.defaultedOnCreate and \
        fieldData.createable
        
    listFieldsRequiredForCreation accepts a Salesforce Object type as its
    lone required argument (Jesse Snyder)

 - Removing unneeded portal_skins FSDV (Jesse Snyder) 

 - Improved docstrings for interfaces (Jesse Snyder)

 - Tested with Plone 3.0 final (Andrew Burkhalter)
